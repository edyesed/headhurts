I have trouble with migraines.  This app is for tracking things as it relates to that topic. 

We query a google calendar for a string, then show other events on that calendar that fit within a time window that you specify.

To run this app, you need: 
  * Keys to connect to the google calendar apis. Reference https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client-samples/tree/master/calendar
  * create the key ( in the Setup Authentication section, above ), and download that to a file named client_secrets.json in this directory.
  * A google calendar.
  
This app does not provide an interface to add things to calendar(s).. For now it's read only.
